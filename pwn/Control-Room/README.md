Description: After unearthing the crashed alien spacecraft you have hacked your way into it's interior. Nothing seems perticularily interesting until you find the spacecraft's control room. Filled with monitors, buttons and panels this room surely contains a lot of important information, including the coordinates of the underground alien vessels that you 've been looking for. You decide to start off by booting up the main computer. You hear an uncanny buzzing-like noise and then a monitor lights up requesting you to enter a username. Can you take control of the Control Room?
