Description: Pandora received an email with a link claiming to have information about the location of the relic and attached ancient city maps, but something seems off about it. Could it be rivals trying to send her off on a distraction? Or worse, could they be trying to hack her systems to get what she knows?Investigate the given attachment and figure out what's going on and get the flag. The link is to http://relicmaps.htb:/relicmaps.one. The document is still live (relicmaps.htb should resolve to your docker instance).
