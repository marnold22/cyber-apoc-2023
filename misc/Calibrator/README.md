# Calibrator

Description: You found the spacectaft's route coordinates and decrypted them and you are finally ready to look them up.
You boot up the spacectaft's map software. The system powers up but you get prompted with an error during boot.
Going through the error you assume the problem is caused by a faulty driver for the map's calibrator.
After a few system restarts without success, you realize the existing driver is broken beyond repair.
Your only hope is writting the calibration driver yourself and injecting to the system right before it boots up.
Snooping through the vessel's archives you stumble upon the calibrator's manual which describes its
functionality and information on how to build the driver firmware. Can you build the driver so the calibration process terminates successfully?
