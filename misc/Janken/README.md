Description: As you approach an ancient tomb, you're met with a wise guru who guards its entrance. In order to proceed, he challenges you to a game of Janken, a variation of rock paper scissors with a unique twist. But there's a catch: you must win 100 rounds in a row to pass. Fail to do so, and you'll be denied entry.
