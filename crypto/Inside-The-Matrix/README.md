Description: As you deciphered the Matrix, you discovered that the astronomy scientist had observed that certain stars were not real. He had created two 5x5 matrices with values based on the time the stars were bright, but after some time, the stars stopped emitting light. Nonetheless, he had managed to capture every matrix until then and created an algorithm that simulated their generation. However, he could not understand what was hidden behind them as he was missing something. He believed that if he could understand the stars, he would be able to locate the secret tombs where the relic was hidden.
