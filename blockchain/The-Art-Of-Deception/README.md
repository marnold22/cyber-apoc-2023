Description: Your cyborg abilities are not always the most effective tools for achieving your goals. Sometimes, you need to go unnoticed and blend in with your surroundings. To achieve this, you must learn to assume new identities and blend in with different groups of people. Mastering the art of deception requires subtlety, observation, and the ability to read people's motivations and intentions. After completing this training, you will emerge as a skilled infiltrator, capable of seamlessly blending in with your surroundings and achieving your objectives with stealth and subtlety. Can you bypass the High Security Gate and sneak into the Fortified Perimeter?
