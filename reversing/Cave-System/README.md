Description: Deep inside a cave system, 500 feet below the surface, you find yourself stranded with supplies running low. Ahead of you sprawls a network of tunnels, branching off and looping back on themselves. You don't have time to explore them all - you'll need to program your cave-crawling robot to find the way out...
