Description: Having now the relic, Pandora is trying to create a plan to shut down the vessels. Unfortunately for her, the alien's intel is one step ahead, as they somehow know what she is up to. An incident response operation started as Pandora was sure the aliens had gained access to her teammate's host. Although many compromised hosts were found, only one sample is applicable for further analysis. If you neutralize this threat by analyzing the sample, Pandora will be able to proceed with her plan.
